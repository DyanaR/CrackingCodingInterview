In-place operation refers to an operation that modifies data directly in the memory location where it is stored, without using extra space. It can lead to more efficient use of memory and, in some cases, faster execution times.

Characteristics of In-Place Operations:
1. Direct Modification: The original data is modified directly.
2. Constant Extra Space: The space complexity is generally O(1), meaning it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
3. No Extra Data Structures: It does not use additional arrays, lists, or other large data structures that grow with the input size.

Problem 1.3:
- In C++ std:string, is not usually managed in-place due to dynamic memory allocation.
- 'insert' method reallocates memory if necessary so not its not strictly in-place.
